## Description üí¨

**Dart** is a programming language developed by Google for building web, mobile, and server applications. It is designed for productivity, offering a familiar syntax similar to C-style languages and features like strong typing, asynchronous programming, and a rich standard library. Dart is well-known for its integration with the Flutter framework, enabling developers to create natively compiled applications for multiple platforms from a single codebase.

This project introduces you to the basics of Dart through a series of simple tasks. Each task is designed to help you become familiar with Dart's syntax, standard functions, and basic programming concepts.
